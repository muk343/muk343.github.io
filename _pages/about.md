Hello, I am Mukul Bhutani. Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer, working on recommendation at Google. Previously, I was Applied Research Engineer in Apple’s search science team for Appstore. Prior to that I graduated with a Master’s degree from Carnegie Mellon University.  The exact name of the program that I was enrolled in was: “Masters in Language Technologies”. It basically means that I got to study and do research in machine learning and NLP. Prior to that, I had a brief stint as a project assistant under Dr. Partha Talukdar.  Even before to that, I was working as a dev at Amazon, Bangalore,  in the India Machine Learning team headed by Rajeev Rastogi.

<br/>
Apart, from science, my other interests include: 
* Writing (poems as well as prose)
* Running (ohk ohk….this is a new one, I just have a couple of half marathons under my belt).

[//]: # Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

[//]: # Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[//]: # Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
