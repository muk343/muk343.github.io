Hi, I am Mukul Bhutani. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Google. We use machine learning to do personalized recommendations and surface right content to a user at the right time. Previously, I was Applied Research Engineer in Apple’s search science team for Appstore. In essence, if you have used a smartphone in the past two years, somewhere or the other you have touched my code.  

Prior to that I graduated with a Master’s degree from [Language Technology Institude](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/), [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at  [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). The exact name of my program was: “Masters in Language Technologies”. It basically means that I got to study and do research work in machine learning and NLP. There, I got a chance to work with great set of peers and an amazing set of professors including [Zico Kolter](https://zicokolter.com/), [Alan Black](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/), and [Alex Rudnicky](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~air/). Prior to that, I had a brief stint as a project assistant under [Dr. Partha Talukdar](https://parthatalukdar.github.io/) at [IISc](https://iisc.ac.in/). 
In what seems like a previous lifetime, I was working as a software dev at Amazon, Bangalore, in the India Machine Learning team. There, I had a great fortune to work with [Arijit Biswas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arijit-biswas-46690236/), [Subhajit Sanyal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/subhajitsanyal/), and [Bamdev Mishra](https://bamdevmishra.in/).  

My research thoughts focus on developing algorithms for machine learning, optimization, and NLP. Lately I have been pondering about methods to study how machines can mimic humans in congitive and reasoning tasks, especially those related to language.

Apart, from science, my other interests include writing poems (as well as prose) and running (ok… it's more of *trying* to get back into running :P).

[//]: # Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[//]: # Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
